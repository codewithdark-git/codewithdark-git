👋 Hi there! I'm Dark, a passionate software developer with a love for coding and problem-solving. I specialize in Python, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things in the tech world.

🚀 Currently, I'm working on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My areas of expertise include backend development, and I'm excited about contributing to open-source projects that align with my interests.

🌐 Outside of coding, you might find me as a Machine Learning Engineer, or exploring the latest advancements in technology. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and GitHub is where I share my code, contribute to projects, and connect with the vibrant developer community.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to explore my repositories, reach out for collaboration, or connect with me on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/codewithdark.fb).

Happy coding! 🚀
